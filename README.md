Coronavirus is a family of viruses that can cause illness, which can vary from common cold and cough to sometimes more severe disease. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) were such severe cases with the world already has faced. 
SARS-CoV-2 (n-coronavirus) is the new virus of the coronavirus family, which first discovered in 2019, which has not been identified in humans before. It is a contiguous virus which started from Wuhan in December 2019. Which later declared as Pandemic by WHO due to high-rate spreads throughout the world. 
Currently (on the date 13 Jan 2021), this leads to a total of over 1.9M Deaths across the globe. Pandemic is spreading all over the world; it becomes more important to understand about this spread.
Research Question:
There are significant number of cases reported across the globe since the start of the Pandemic, with some countries reported significantly higher number of cases than others. 
But how accurate are those data presented? For countries with lower number of confirmed cases, can we rely on those data to represent the true situation? Or are those low numbers simply due to insufficient number of testing performed? How serious is the true situation if the number of testing is increased?
